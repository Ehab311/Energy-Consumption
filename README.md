## Project Overview:
This project aims to predict energy consumption based on various factors such as time of day, day of the week, type of load, etc. The dataset contains information about energy usage along with other relevant parameters. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast energy consumption, which can be valuable for resource planning and optimization.

## Project Structure:
Importing Necessary Libraries: Importing required Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. Libraries include pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn modules.

## Reading Data: Loading the dataset from CSV files (Train.csv and Test.csv) into pandas DataFrames (net_train and net_test) for further analysis and modeling. Displaying the first few rows and column information of the datasets.

Preprocessing on Date Columns and Filling Null Values: Preprocessing the date column by splitting it into separate columns for date and time. Handling missing values in columns related to day of the week and week status.

Preprocess the Categorical Data: Handling categorical data by encoding ordinal and nominal variables. Dealing with unbalanced categories and visualizing category distributions.

Preprocess the Numerical Data: Preprocessing numerical data by visualizing distributions and handling outliers. Filling missing values with the median to ensure robustness.

## Model Selection: Training linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression models. Comparing mean squared errors to select the best model for energy consumption prediction.

Plotting the Learning Curve and Applying Cross Validation: Visualizing the learning curve to evaluate model performance. Applying cross-validation to assess model generalization and avoid overfitting.

## Usage Instructions:
Dependencies Installation: Make sure to have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Data Loading: Ensure that the dataset files (Train.csv and Test.csv) are in the same directory as the code files.

## Code Execution: Execute the code files in a Python environment. The main script should be run after ensuring the data files' availability.

## Model Evaluation: Analyze the model performance metrics such as mean squared error and learning curves to assess the predictive accuracy of the chosen model.

## Further Improvements: Feel free to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, or model architectures to potentially enhance prediction performance.
